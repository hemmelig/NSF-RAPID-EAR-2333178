## BUDGET JUSTIFICATION

### A. Travel

Travel costs include funds for the field season in Iceland for two people to participate in the deployment and one person in the recovery. Airfare, subsistence, car rental, and fuel are requested. Access to the central highlands of Iceland, where the field site is located, requires a 4x4 vehicle with sufficient carrying capacity for the instruments to be deployed.

All airfare is based on non-refundable 14-day advance purchase. Current subsistence rates are obtained from GSA.gov.

### B. Other Direct Costs

1. Materials/Supplies: Funds ($9,068) are requested for auxiliary power infrastructure required for six high resolution magnetometer devices. These devices consume approximately 1 W of power, which on average equates to approximately 300 Ahr of battery storage capacity and 90 W of solar panels for recharging. This will see the instruments through the approximately 3 months of darkness over winter. In country suppliers have been identified for the panels and batteries, with cost estimates based on previous years/quotes. Costs include:

2. Publication costs/documentation/dissemination: None

3. Consultant Services: None

4. Computer Services: None

5. Subawards: None

6. Other:  
    *Shipping:* We request funds ($1,000) to cover shipping of equipment on loan from EPIC (EarthScope Primary Instrument Center) from New Mexico to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and then on to Iceland.  
    *Services:* We request costs ($4,392) for a field assistant who will perform aerial magnetic surveys of the Askja caldera using a Matrice 600 Pro drone equipped with a MagArrow device. Dr Elisa Piispa, Háskoli Íslands (University of Iceland), has agreed to conduct these surveys. Háskoli Íslands charges a small fee to cover the upkeep of the drone and magnetometer.
