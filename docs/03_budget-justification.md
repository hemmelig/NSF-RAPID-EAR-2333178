## BUDGET JUSTIFICATION

### Travel

$17,296 is requested to support travel expenses for the first field season in Iceland (August 2023). This includes flights to/from Iceland for PI Bacon, and one field assistant ($2,000), ground transportation ($2,500), per diem for 12 days ($276/day via https://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp), shipping ($1,000), field assistant salary ($1,800), and drone rental ($1,440). In this field season we will deploy the ground-based magnetometers and conduct an aeromagnetic survey.

### Materials and Supplies

$9,608 is requested to cover the costs of purchasing the auxiliary power infrastructure required for six high-resolution magnetometer devices. These devices consume approximately 1 W of power, which on average equates to approximately 300 Ahr of battery storage capacity and 90 W of solar panels for recharging. This will see the instruments through the approximately 3 months of darkness over winter. In country suppliers have been identified for the panels and batteries, with cost estimates based on previous years/quotes.

### Indirect Costs

The standard on-campus rate of 55.5% (for Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) has been applied.
