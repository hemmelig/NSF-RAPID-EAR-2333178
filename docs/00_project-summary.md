## PROJECT SUMMARY

### Overview
Askja volcano—situated in Iceland's Northern Volcanic Zone—last erupted in 1961, with a 0.7 km-long fissure opening and releasing 500 m-high lava fountains. In the the intervening decades, the caldera-forming volcano has continued to deflate at a decaying rate. In August 2021, this trend rapidly reversed and Askja began to reinflate, with over 0.5 m of uplift observed at the center of inflation. Geodetic modelling of the available InSAR and GNSS positioning data has revealed a shallow sill-like magmatic source can explain the observed deformation, but the exact origin of the magma remains unclear. Recent modelling of a number of recent eruptions has shown that changes in the subsurface distribution of magma can produce a measurable change in the local magnetic field at the surface, but there are few to no datasets that capture such events in-situ making the modelling approach difficult to validate. We propose to install a campaign network of passive magnetometers in and around Askja to capture the changes in the local magnetic field due to the continued influx of magma into the shallow crust. With these data we will establish the value of such networks in volcanic systems, while also providing additional constraints for models that combine concurrent gravity surveys and continuous GNSS positioning observations.

### Intellectual Merit


### Broader Impacts
This deployment could pave the way towards a new, powerful tool for studying the evolution of magmatic systems both during crises and times of repose. Magnetometers are significantly less expensive than other potential field sensors such as gravimeters—widespread adoption of this method would disproportionately benefit developing nations with high volcanic risk and low monitoring budgets (Philippines, D.R. Congo, etc.). The low-cost magnetometers are made with off-the-shelf components. The plans, code, and parts list will be made publicly available.
