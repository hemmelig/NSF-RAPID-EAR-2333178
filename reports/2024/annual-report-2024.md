## ACCOMPLISHMENTS

###  What are the major goals of the project?

The objectives of this project are two-fold:

- to measure changes in the local magnetic field that could be associated with changes to the subsurface magma storage system, indicated by ongoing inflation seen in GNSS observations at Askja volcano;
- and to compare the performance of the Lemi fluxgate magnetometer systems (hereafter described as 'fine-resolution' magnetometers) with a low-cost alternative being developed by project co-PI Joe Biasi (hereafter described as 'coarse-resolution' magnetometers). One of these devices were co-located with each Lemi system.

Modeling work has shown that volcanic activity (i.e., the movement of magma before and during eruptions) should have a measurable affect on the local magnetic field. There are currently few real world datasets with which to test this hypothesis. Askja volcano began to re-inflate in August 2021, with inversion of geodetic data (GPS and microgravity surveys) suggesting the emplacement of a shallow (~2 km depth) sill. Should we successfully record and isolate the signal associated with inflation, we hope to be able to obtain a similar constraint on volcanic activity as provided by gravimetry, at a fraction of the cost.

To accomplish these goals, we deployed a temporary network of continuous magnetometers in and around Askja caldera, which record continuous, 3-component local magnetic field data. The aim with this network is to collect 2 years of high-quality, continuous magnetic field data and look for changes through time that can be tied to changes in the distribution of magma in the subsurface. The network deployment was a success, and our first service after 1 year had a data recovery rate of >93%.

### What was accomplished under these goals and objectives (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?

#### Major Activities
In August 2023, the network of instruments were deployed in and around Askja caldera. The Lemi systems were equipped with a field-tested power system consisting of a bank of 3x100 Ah deep-cycle AGM lead-acid batteries, a low-noise solar controller, and a 100 W solar panel. 11 coarse-resolution magnetometers were also deployed. Aeromagnetic surveys were conducted at each fine-resolution magnetometer deployment site, and representative hand samples were collected, in order to provide context for the data recorded by the instruments. In addition to the aerial surveys, a high-quality absolute field magnetometer was used to measure the local magnetic field at a number of pre-existing survey benchmarks inside the caldera. These benchmarks can be repeatedly measured year-on-year to provide an additional dataset.

A servicing trip was conducted in late July 2024. Data recovery from the fine-resolution magnetometers was in excess of 93%, with most losses arising from an abnormally late snow melt.

#### Specific Objectives

The coarse-resolution magnetometers have now been field tested for a year, which should provide significant information with which to improve their design for future deployments.

#### Significant Results

#### Key outcomes or Other achievements

### What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?

- Experience in drone-based aeromagnetic surveying, including the setup and design of surveys in the relevant control software.
- Field experience in Iceland for a number of individuals, including a PhD student.
- Establishment of connections between colleagues at institutions in the US and Iceland, which may lead to further collaborative work.

### Have the results been disseminated to communities of interest? If so, please provide details

Some preliminary results will be presented the Cascades24 meeting in August, 2024, as well as at the AGU Fall Meeting in December, 2024.

### What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?

With the first year of data in hand, we will proceed with our analysis of the time-series data. This includes:

- finalising modelling of the expected changes in the local magnetic field using the most up-to-date information from microgravity and GPS surveys;
- correcting the time-series data for temperature variations. It is clear from the recorded data that there is a dependency between the measured field and temperature at the sensor. The ground is frozen and insulated by snow for most of the year, which means the measured field remains largely unaffected, but the field during summer does need to be corrected;
- comparing the performance of the coarse- and fine-resolution magnetometers;
- and looking for changes in the local magnetic field that can be associated with inflation and compare with the aforementioned modelling results.

We will also provide the EarthScope Primary Instrument Center (EPIC) with a report providing detailed feedback on the performance of the Lemi systems.

In July 2025, we will return to Askja to recover the instruments. All data will be archived with the EarthScope Data Management Center and made openly available.

## IMPACT

### What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?

We are the first group to deploy this particular model of fine-resolution magnetometer systems on a long-term basis. We will feed our findings back to the EarthScope Primary Instrument Center, which should improve the situation for future users, should the technique explored prove to be useful.

### What is the impact on other disciplines?

Magnetometry experiments such as this one have the potential to provide similar information as microgravity surveys, at a fraction of the cost. Higher spatial resolution, with lower financial risk in the event of an eruption, may make this a valuable addition to other typical geophysical surveys of volcanic systems.

### What is the impact on technology transfer?

This deployment is the first time of its kind supported by the EPIC facility, meaning we will be providing useful insights into the feasibility of long-term deployments of Lemi systems. The coarse-resolution magnetometer designs will also be made openly available for other researchers to build and deploy. 

### What is the impact on society beyond science and technology?

May potentially prove to be a useful technique for understanding the evolution of subsurface magma storage systems.

### What percentage of the award's budget was spent in a foreign country?

Approximately 5% of the total award's budget has been spent in the United States, with 75% of the total award spent in Iceland so far. There is approximately 20% of the award's budget left to be spent.
